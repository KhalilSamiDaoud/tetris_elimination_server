**Tetris Elemination Server, by Khalil S. Daoud**

Tetris Elimination is a multiplayer twist on tetris that allows up to 5 users to play tetris with each other in an elimination style match. The project consists of a server and a GUI with custom designed assets designed with C# and WPF.

The server also allows users to input commands by having both a lobby controller and command thread.
